---++ Foswiki 2.0 Store refactor prototype

We think that the Store <-> Object codebase is too convoluted, and can be done better for the next release of Foswiki.

Key performance indicators for acceptance of this major re-write will be:
   1 faster
   2 more complete test suite
   3 simpler and more useable API for both the core, and store backend
   4 faster :)
